## Useful Regexes

| Type                   | Regex                                                                   | Example input                               | Example output                                       | Description                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| full process addresses | `^([a-z0-9-_.]+)@([a-z0-9\-_]+):([a-z0-9-_]+):([a-z0-9-_.]+)$` | `undefined.os@process:package:publisher.os` | `undefined.os`, `process`, `package`, `publisher.os` | Separates a process address into node, process, package and publisher. |
| process IDs            | `^([a-z0-9-_]+):([a-z0-9-_]+):([a-z0-9-_.]+)$`                          | `process:package:publisher.os`              | `process`, `package`, `publisher.os`                 | Separates a process address into process, package and publisher.       |
| package IDs            | `^([a-z0-9-_]+):([a-z0-9-_.]+)$`                                        | `package:publisher.os`                      | `package`, `publisher.os`                            | Separates a process address into package and publisher.                |
| KNS names              | `^([a-z0-9-_]+)\.([a-z]+)$`                                             | `undefined.os`                              | `undefined`, `os`                                    | Separates a KNS name into name and TLD.                                |

To ensure forward compatibility, these regexes do not require any TLD such as `.os` or `.eth` (except for the KNS name regex).
Additionally, only alphanumeric characters, `-` and `_` are allowed within names.
